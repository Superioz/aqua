**aqua** is a simple file uploading and sharing server for personal use. It is built to be easy to set up and host on your own server, for example to use it in combination with
uploading tools like [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/).

It is the successor/rework of my previous project [lightf](https://github.com/Superioz/lightf), but this time without trying weird things out and building a complete product instead.
